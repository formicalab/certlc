# This file enables modules to be automatically managed by the Functions service.
# See https://aka.ms/functionsmanageddependency for additional information.
#
# NOTE: DO NOT USE WITH FLEX FUNCTIONS - managed dependencies are not supported in the Flex Consumption plan.
# Do "Save-Module -Name <ModuleName> -Path Modules -Repository PSGallery -Force" to add modules to the Modules folder instead.
